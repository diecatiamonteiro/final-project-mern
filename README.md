# Pending Project Name (MERN Stack)
## TO BE FULLY UPDATED!!!

See live demo [here](https://alt-west-connect-neighbourhood-helper.vercel.app/).

**Note**: The back end is hosted on Render's free tier - please allow ~10 seconds for the initial load while the server spins up from the cold start.

## 1. Project Overview

Neighbourhood Helper is a community-driven platform where users can request or offer small favours. Whether you need a ride, groceries, or quick assistance, the app connects people in Alt-West Leipzig willing to help within their neighbourhood.

Users can:

- Browser help requests
- Register and login
- Offer help
- Ask for help
- Edit and delete help requests
- Accept or decline help offers from other users
- Edit their user account data (e.g., username, password)
- Delete their own accounts and related requests and offers

## 4. Data Structure (MongoDB & Mongoose)

#### 4.1. User Collection (to store user information)

```js
{
  username: { type: String, required, unique },
  firstName: { type: String, required },
  lastName: { type: String, required },
  email: { type: String, required, unique },
  password: { type: String, required },
  zipCode: {
    type: String,
    enum: [
      "04177 Lindenau, Alt-Lindenau, Neu-Lindenau",
      "04178 Böhlitz-Ehrenberg, Rückmarsdorf, Burghausen",
      "04179 Leutzsch",
    ],
    required,
  },
  requests: [{ type: Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: "Request" }], // Requests posted by the user
  offers: [{ type: Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: "Offer" }], // Offers made by the user
  offersReceived: [{ type: Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: "Offer" }], // Offers received on user's requests
  createdAt: { type: Date, default: Date.now },
}
```

#### 4.2. Request Collection (to store help requests information)

```js
{
  userId: { type: Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: "User" }, // Who posted it
  description: { type: String, required },
  category: {
    type: String,
    enum: [
      "Errands",
      "Groceries",
      "Transport",
      "Household",
      "Pet Care",
      "Childcare",
      "Tutoring",
      "Tech Support",
      "Moving",
    ],
    default: "Errands",
  },
  when: { type: String, required },
  status: { type: String, enum: ["open", "helped"], default: "open" },
  acceptedHelper: { type: Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: "User" }, // Who helped (not the user who posted the request)
  receivedOffers: [{ type: Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: "Offer" }], // Offers received on a request (not the offers made by the user)
  createdAt: { type: Date, default: Date.now },
}
```

Note: Zip Code is already set when user registers.

#### 4.3. Offer Collection (to store help offers information)

```js
{
  requestId: { type: Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: "Request" }, // To which request
  helperId: { type: Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: "User" }, // Who offered help
  message: { type: String, required: true },
  createdAt: { type: Date, default: Date.now },
}
```

## 5. Backend API Design (Express & MongoDB)

#### 5.1. User Routes (`/users`)

| Method | Endpoint        | Description                                                  | Logged in User? |
| ------ | -----------     | ------------------------------------------------------       | --------------- |
| POST   | `/register`     | Create a new user                                            | ❌ No           |
| POST   | `/login`        | Authenticate user & return JWT token                         | ❌ No           |
| POST   | `/login/google` | Authenticate user & return JWT token (registration & login)  | ❌ No           |
| GET    | `/logout`       | Log out user                                                 | ✅ Yes          |
| GET    | `/data`         | Fetch logged-in user data                                    | ✅ Yes          |
| PATCH  | `/update`       | Update user data                                             | ✅ Yes          |
| DELETE | `/delete`       | Delete user account and all related offers & requests.       | ✅ Yes          |

#### How will the frontend use these?

- The register & login pages will use `/register` and `/login`.
- The frontend will store the JWT token in localStorage or cookies to authenticate the user.
- After login, the app will use `GET /data` to show the logged-in user's profile or dashboard, and to keep user logged in after refreshing page.

#### 5.2. Requests Routes (`/requests`)

| Method | Endpoint          | Description                            | Logged in User? |
| ------ | ----------------- | -------------------------------------- | --------------- |
| GET    | `/`               | Display all requests on homepage       | ❌ No           |
| GET    | `/:id`            | View details of a specific request     | ❌ No           |
| GET    | `/my-requests`    | Fetch all requests from logged-in user | ✅ Yes          |
| POST   | `/`               | Create a new help request              | ✅ Yes          |
| PATCH  | `/:id`            | Request creator edits their request    | ✅ Yes          |
| DELETE | `/:id`            | Request creator deletes their request  | ✅ Yes          |

#### How will the frontend use these?

- The homepage (`GET /requests`) will display all requests.
- The request card (`GET /requests/:id`) will show details of a specific request.
- The create request page (`POST /requests`) will let users add a new request.
- The edit request page (`PATCH /requests/:id`) will allow modifying a request.
- A delete button (`DELETE /requests/:id`) will let users remove their request.

#### 5.3. Offers Routes (`/offers`)

| Method | Endpoint           | Description                                      | Logged in User? |
| ------ | ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------ | --------------- |
| GET    | `/my-offers`       | Fetch all offers from logged-in user             | ✅ Yes          |
| POST   | `/:requestId`      | Post an offer on a request                       | ✅ Yes          |
| GET    | `/:requestId`      | Fetch all offers for a specific request          | ✅ Yes          |
| DELETE | `/cancel/:offerId` | User cancels own offers                          | ✅ Yes          |
| DELETE | `/reject/:offerId` | User rejects offers from other users             | ✅ Yes          |
| PATCH  | `/accept/:offerId` | Request owner accepts an offer                   | ✅ Yes          |
| PATCH  | `/:offerId`        | Offer owner edits their offer (NOT APPLIED)      | ✅ Yes          |

#### How will the frontend use these?

- On a request card, users will see a button "Offer Help" → This calls `POST /offers/:requestId`.
- The request owner can see who offered help → This uses `GET /offers/:requestId`.
- If a user wants to refuse a help offer, they will use `DELETE /offers/:offerId`.
- If a user wants to accept a help offer, they will use `PATCH /offers/:offerId`.
